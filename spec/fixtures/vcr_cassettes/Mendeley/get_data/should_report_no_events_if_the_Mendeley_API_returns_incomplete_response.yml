        is essential for solid tumour growth, whilst the molecular profiles of tumour
        blood vessels have been reported to be different between cancer types. Although
        presently available anti-angiogenic strategies are providing some promise
        for the treatment of some cancers it is perhaps not surprisingly that, none
        of the anti-angiogenic agents available work on all tumours. Thus, the discovery
        of novel anti-angiogenic targets, relevant to individual cancer types, is
        required. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis of laser-captured, CD31-positive
        blood vessels we have identified 63 genes that are upregulated significantly
        (5-72 fold) in angiogenic blood vessels associated with human invasive ductal
        carcinoma (IDC) of the breast as compared with blood vessels in normal human
        breast. We tested the angiogenic capacity of a subset of these genes. Genes
        were selected based on either their known cellular functions, their enriched
        expression in endothelial cells and/or their sensitivity to anti-VEGF treatment;
        all features implicating their involvement in angiogenesis. For example, RRM2,
        a ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, was upregulated 32-fold
        in IDC-associated blood vessels; ATF1, a nuclear activating transcription
        factor involved in cellular growth and survival was upregulated 23-fold in
        IDC-associated blood vessels and HEX-B, a hexosaminidase involved in the breakdown
        of GM2 gangliosides, was upregulated 8-fold in IDC-associated blood vessels.
        Furthermore, in silico analysis confirmed that AFT1 and HEX-B also were enriched
        in endothelial cells when compared with non-endothelial cells. None of these
        genes have been reported previously to be involved in neovascularisation.
        However, our data establish that siRNA depletion of Rrm2, Atf1 or Hex-B had
        significant anti-angiogenic effects in VEGF-stimulated ex vivo mouse aortic
        ring assays. Overall, our results provide proof-of-principle that our approach
        can identify a cohort of potentially novel anti-angiogenic targets that are
        likley to be, but not exclusivley, relevant to breast cancer.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/gene-expression-analysis-human-breast-cancer-associated-blood-vessels","reader_count":33,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Professor":2,"Post
