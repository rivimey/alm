        inflammation is a leading cause of hospital death. Mild systemic inflammation
        is accompanied by warmth-seeking behavior (and fever), whereas severe inflammation
        is associated with cold-seeking behavior (and hypothermia). Both behaviors
        are adaptive. Which brain structures mediate which behavior is unknown. The
        involvement of hypothalamic structures, namely, the preoptic area (POA), paraventricular
        nucleus (PVH), or dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), in thermoregulatory behaviors
        associated with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS])-induced systemic inflammation
        was studied in rats. The rats were allowed to select their thermal environment
        by freely moving in a thermogradient apparatus. A low intravenous dose of
        Escherichia coli LPS (10 microg/kg) caused warmth-seeking behavior, whereas
        a high, shock-inducing dose (5,000 microg/kg) caused cold-seeking behavior.
        Bilateral electrocoagulation of the PVH or DMH, but not of the POA, prevented
        this cold-seeking response. Lesioning the DMH with ibotenic acid, an excitotoxin
        that destroys neuronal bodies but spares fibers of passage, also prevented
        LPS-induced cold-seeking behavior; lesioning the PVH with ibotenate did not
        affect it. Lesion of no structure affected cold-seeking behavior induced by
        heat exposure or by pharmacological stimulation of the transient receptor
        potential (TRP) vanilloid-1 channel (\"warmth receptor\"). Nor did any lesion
        affect warmth-seeking behavior induced by a low dose of LPS, cold exposure,
        or pharmacological stimulation of the TRP melastatin-8 (\"cold receptor\").
        We conclude that LPS-induced cold-seeking response is mediated by neuronal
        bodies located in the DMH and neural fibers passing through the PVH. These
        are the first two landmarks on the map of the circuitry of cold-seeking behavior
        associated with endotoxin shock.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/neural-substrate-coldseeking-behavior-endotoxin-shock","reader_count":26,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Professor":1,"Associate
