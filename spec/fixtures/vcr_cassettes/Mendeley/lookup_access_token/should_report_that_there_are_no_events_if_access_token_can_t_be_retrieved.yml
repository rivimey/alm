        High levels of alcohol consumption and increases in heavy episodic drinking
        (binge drinking) are a growing public concern, due to their association with
        increased risk of personal and societal harm. Alcohol consumption has been
        shown to be sensitive to factors such as price and availability. The aim of
        this study was to explore the influence of glass shape on the rate of consumption
        of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nMETHODS: This was an experimental
        design with beverage (lager, soft drink), glass (straight, curved) and quantity
        (6 fl oz, 12 fl oz) as between-subjects factors. Social male and female alcohol
        consumers (n = 159) attended two experimental sessions, and were randomised
        to drink either lager or a soft drink from either a curved or straight-sided
        glass, and complete a computerised task identifying perceived midpoint of
        the two glasses (order counterbalanced). Ethical approval was granted by the
        Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol.
        The primary outcome measures were total drinking time of an alcoholic or non-alcoholic
        beverage, and perceptual judgement of the half-way point of a straight and
        curved glass.\\n\\nRESULTS: Participants were 60% slower to consume an alcoholic
        beverage from a straight glass compared to a curved glass. This effect was
        only observed for a full glass and not a half-full glass, and was not observed
        for a non-alcoholic beverage. Participants also misjudged the half-way point
        of a curved glass to a greater degree than that of a straight glass, and there
        was a trend towards a positive association between the degree of error and
        total drinking time.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS: Glass shape appears to influence the
        rate of drinking of alcoholic beverages. This may represent a modifiable target
        for public health interventions.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/glass-shape-influences-consumption-rate-alcoholic-beverages","reader_count":99,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Professor":3,"Associate
