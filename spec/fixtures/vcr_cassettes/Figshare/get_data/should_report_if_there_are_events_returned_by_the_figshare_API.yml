        has played a major role during the evolution of angiosperms, mediating both
        gene flow between already distinct species and the formation of new species.
        Newly formed hybrids between distantly related taxa are often sterile. For
        this reason, interspecific crosses resulting in fertile hybrids have rarely
        been described to take place after more than a few million years after divergence.
        We describe here the traces of a reproductively successful hybrid between
        two ancestral species of <i>Silene</i>, diverged for about six million years
        prior to hybridization. No extant hybrids between the two parental lineages
        are currently known, but introgression of the RNA polymerase gene <i>NRPA2</i>
        provides clear evidence of a temporary and fertile hybrid. Parsimony reconciliation
        between gene trees and the species tree, as well as consideration of clade
        ages, help exclude gene paralogy and lineage sorting as alternative hypotheses.
        This may represent one of the most extreme cases of divergence between species
        prior to introgressive hybridization discovered yet, notably at a homoploid
        level. Although species boundaries are generally believed to be stable after
        millions of years of divergence, we believe that this finding may indicate
        that gene flow between distantly related species is merely largely undetected
        at present.</p></div>", "links": [], "tags": ["Evolutionary biology", "Evolutionary
