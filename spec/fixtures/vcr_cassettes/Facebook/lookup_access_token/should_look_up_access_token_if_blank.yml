        levels of alcohol consumption and increases in heavy episodic drinking (binge
        drinking) are a growing public concern, due to their association with increased
        risk of personal and societal harm. Alcohol consumption has been shown to
        be sensitive to factors such as price and availability. The aim of this study
        was to explore the influence of glass shape on the rate of consumption of
        alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.    Methods  This was an experimental
        design with beverage (lager, soft drink), glass (straight, curved) and quantity
        (6 fl oz, 12 fl oz) as between-subjects factors. Social male and female alcohol
        consumers ( n \u200a=\u200a159) attended two experimental sessions, and were
        randomised to drink either lager or a soft drink from either a curved or straight-sided
        glass, and complete a computerised task identifying perceived midpoint of
        the two glasses (order counterbalanced). Ethical approval was granted by the
        Faculty of Science Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol.
        The primary outcome measures were total drinking time of an alcoholic or non-alcoholic
        beverage, and perceptual judgement of the half-way point of a straight and
        curved glass.    Results  Participants were 60\u0025 slower to consume an
        alcoholic beverage from a straight glass compared to a curved glass. This
        effect was only observed for a full glass and not a half-full glass, and was
        not observed for a non-alcoholic beverage. Participants also misjudged the
        half-way point of a curved glass to a greater degree than that of a straight
        glass, and there was a trend towards a positive association between the degree
        of error and total drinking time.    Conclusions  Glass shape appears to influence
        the rate of drinking of alcoholic beverages. This may represent a modifiable
        target for public health interventions.","title":"Glass Shape Influences Consumption
