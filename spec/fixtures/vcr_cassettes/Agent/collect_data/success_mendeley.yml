        One of the most intriguing patterns in mammalian biogeography is the \"island
        rule\", which states that colonising species have a tendency to converge in
        body size, with larger species evolving decreased sizes and smaller species
        increased sizes. It has recently been suggested that an analogous pattern
        holds for the colonisation of the deep-sea benthos by marine Gastropoda. In
        particular, a pioneering study showed that gastropods from the Western Atlantic
        showed the same graded trend from dwarfism to gigantism that is evident in
        island endemic mammals. However, subsequent to the publication of the gastropod
        study, the standard tests of the island rule have been shown to yield false
        positives at a very high rate, leaving the result open to doubt. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
        FINDINGS: The evolution of gastropod body size in the deep sea is reexamined.
        Using an extended and updated data set, and improved statistical methods,
        it is shown that some results of the previous study may have been artifactual,
        but that its central conclusion is robust. It is further shown that the effect
        is not restricted to a single gastropod clade, that its strength increases
        markedly with depth, but that it applies even in the mesopelagic zone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
        The replication of the island rule in a distant taxonomic group and a partially
        analogous ecological situation could help to uncover the causes of the patterns
        observed--which are currently much disputed. The gastropod pattern is evident
        at intermediate depths, and so cannot be attributed to the unique features
        of abyssal ecology.","link":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/island-rule-deepsea-gastropods-reexamining-evidence","reader_count":46,"reader_count_by_academic_status":{"Professor":2,"Associate
