## DataCite Event Data

The DataCite Event Data service collects events around DataCite DOIs. The events are found via the **relatedIdentifier** and **nameIdentifier** attributes of DataCite Metadata, and via external services that collect information about DataCite DOIs.

Examples of events include references to related data, data citations in journal articles, and new versions of a work.

Please contact DataCite staff for more information.
