## Lagotto 5.0 (April 12, 2016)

[Lagotto 5.0](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/releases/tag/v.5.0) was released on April 12, 2016. This release includes breaking changes, users of Lagotto 4.x should wait for Lagotto 5.2, which will provide an upgrade path for 4.x users.

The following changes were made:

### Agents/Sources

In Lagotto 5.0 the functionality of sources is broken into two different models:

* **agents** collect information from external APIs
* **sources** provide this information via the Lagotto API

One consequence of this split of functionality is that agents can now be external to the Lagotto application.

Another consequence is that agents no longer need to do API calls for every single work, but can import data in bulk. This dramatically improves performance.

### Deposits

The new deposits API provides a common way to import data into Lagotto from external APIs. Import of data via rake task, as in previous Lagotto versions, is no longer supported in Lagotto 5.0. The deposits API is also used by the built-in Lagotto agents.

The deposits API is generic enough to allow not only the import of works, but also publishers and contrbutors.

### Publishers
Added automatic import of publisher information from Crossref and DataCite ([#430](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/430)).

### Contributors
* add contributor model ([#429](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/429))

### JSON API snapshots

The snapshots of the Lagotto JSON API require the same ENV variables as the CSV export. Run `bundle exec rake api:snapshot:all` to create the snapshots and export them to Zenodo. More information is available in the `setup` documentation.

### Foreign keys

This release adds foreign keys (supported in Rails core since [Rails 4.2](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2014/12/19/Rails-4-2-final/)) to the database to enforce referential integrity.

### Registration agency checks

Some sources now check for the work registration agency, allowing different functionality, e.g. for CrossRef or DataCite DOIs.

### DataONE usage stats

This release adds two sources that collect usage stats from the DataONE repository network. The `dataone_counter` source collects COUNTER-compliant usage stats, whereas the `dataone_usage` source also includes machine usage from some useragents.

This release includes numerous other small bug fixes. While the release fixes on bug fixes, new features were also introduced:

### Recommendations

A list of similar works that we also track, generated by common relations, e.g. other works tracked by Lagotto cited
by the same paper or bookmarked in the same ORCID profile. Available in the v6 API, e.g. [here](http://alm.plos.org/api/works/doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097/recommendations).

### Identifiers as URIs

Starting with this release, the `id` for a work in the v6 API will always be a URL, e.g. `http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000097`, and the use of `dx.doi.org` has been
changed to `doi.org` in all places.

### Second-order Events

Lagotto 4.1 adds support for second-order events, i.e. it will track news items and blog posts that discuss a work in Lagotto.
We do the same for scholarly articles that mention a tracked work in the body text (where we can search the fulltext), e.g. informal citations to datasets.

## Lagotto 4.0 (May 5, 2015)

[Lagotto 4.0](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/releases/tag/v.4.0) was released on May 5, 2015 with the following changes:

* normalized responses from external sources to be stored in MySQL. CouchDB is no longer required for the core Lagotto functionality ([#213](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/213))
* show more CSL information in API and admin dashboard ([#284](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/284))
* started new v6 API ([#287](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/287))
* show related works (references and versions) in new v6 API and admin dashboard ([#296](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/296))
* added `ads` and `ads_fulltext` data sources. `ads` finds ArXiV preprints that became peer-reviewed papers, `ads_fulltext` allows fulltext search for all ArXiV preprints ([#297](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/297))
* import couchdb data into mysql for 4.0 upgrade ([#301](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/301))

### Upgrading

Starting with Lagotto 4.0 frontend assets are installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). This is done automatically when using Chef/Vagrant. When not using Chef/Vagarant please copy `frontend/node_modules`, `frontend/bower_components`, `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/bower.json` and `frontend/.bowerrc` into `shared` and run `npm install` (not `npm -g install`) from `shared/frontend`:

```
cd /var/www/lagotto/shared/frontend
mkdir node_modules
mkdir bower_components
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lagotto/lagotto/4-0-stable/frontend/package.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lagotto/lagotto/4-0-stable/frontend/bower.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lagotto/lagotto/4-0-stable/frontend/.bowerrc
npm install
```

CouchDB is no longer needed for core Lagotto functionality, but is still used to store responses from some of the sources (e.g. `F1000`).

Make sure to run the data migrations in addition to the database migrations. This happens automatically if using capistrano, otherwise run `rake data:migrate`.

After upgrading the code and running the database migrations, old monthly and daily data stored in CouchDB should be imported via:

```
bundle exec rake couchdb:import
```

Starting with the new v6 API, API versions (currently defaulting to version 6) and authentication via API key (needed for admin functionality) are provided via the HTTP header, e.g. in curl:

```
- H "Accept: application/json; version=6" -H "Authorization: Token token=API_KEY"
```

## Lagotto 3.20 (May 5, 2015)

[Lagotto 3.20](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/releases/tag/v.3.20) was released on May 5, 2015 with the following changes:

* fixed authentication error that broke creation of new user accounts ([#286](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/286))
* create delete canonical_url rake task for cases where journal URLs change ([#298](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/298))
* set rate-limit remaining number for all sources using memcached. This should fix rate-limiting errors with the `twitter_search` source ([#300](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/300))

Make sure to run the data migrations in addition to the database migrations. This happens automatically if using capistrano, otherwise run `rake data:migrate`.

* hard-code configuration URLs for sources, making it easier to automatically change these parameters via an upgrade ([#271](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/271))
* updated documentation to how correct service URLs for sources ([#273](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/273))
* upgrade to Rails 4.2.1 ([#275](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/275))
* switched from `jasmine_rails` to `teaspoon` for running javascript `jasmine` unit tests ([#276](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/276))
* only create one alert per message ([#277](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/277))
* fixed bug in generating report with mendeley, pmc or counter data ([#279](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/279))
* added data migrations, making it easier to update data, e.g. when the database schema changes ([#280](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/280))

To customize the signposts, add/uncomment the following ENV variables in your `.env` file, separating multiple sources via comma:

```sh

```

Also, make sure the following ENV variable is set in your `.env` file:

```sh
# number of threads Sidekiq uses
CONCURRENCY=25
```

No redis or sidekiq configuration is necessary, but make sure all `delayed_job` worker processes are killed when upgrading.

```sh
https://graph.facebook.com/fql?access_token=%{access_token}&q=select url, share_count, like_count, comment_count, click_count, total_count from link_stat where url = '%{query_url}'
```

* many small bug fixes ([#147](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/147), [#148](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/148), [#149](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/149), [#150](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/150), [#151](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/151), [#152](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/152), [#153](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/153), [#154](https://github.com/lagotto/lagotto/issues/154))

Starting with the Lagotto 3.7 release all user-specific configuration options for Rails, as well as for the server configuration and deployment tools Vagrant, Chef and Capistrano are environment variables, and can be stored in a single `.env` file.

```yaml
import: member
```

To import articles manually, leave import empty; or use one of the following options for automated daily import via cron:

* `import: all`: All DOIs updated the last day
* `import: sample`: A random sample of 20 from all DOIs updated the last day
* `import: member`: All DOIs from the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last day
* `import: member_sample`: A random sample of 20 from all DOIs from the publishers in the publisher admin interface, updated the last day

Publishers can now be added in the admin interface. The only functionality is currently the automated article import described above.

For admin users alerts are now available via API, use the `/api/v4/alerts` endpoint and basic authentication. More details in the API documentation.

There is one configuration change in error reporting: the `disabled_source_report` has been renamed to `fatal_error_report`, as an immediate email will now be sent for all errors with severity `FATAL`. To rename the report template in the database, run this rake task once (using the appropriate `RAILS_ENV`):

bundle exec rake mailer:rename_report RAILS_ENV=production
```

## ALM 2.8 (July 22, 2013)

[ALM 2.8](https://github.com/lagotto/alm/releases/tag/v.2.8) was released on July 22, 2013. The development work focused on user account management.

#### User accounts

Prior to this release, the ALM application allowed only a single user account. We can now have multiple user accounts, plus different roles for them:

* API user - to obtain an API key
* staff - read-only access to the admin dashboard
* admin - full access to the admin dashboard

A new user admin dashboard facilitates user management.

#### Social login

To facilitate account management for users and ALM admins, new user accounts can only be created via social login with one of these services:

* [Github OAuth](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)
* [Mozilla Persona](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/)

The ALM application can be configured to use one of these services (but not both), or to use the old system of only a single admin user. The documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

#### API keys

Now that API keys are created within the ALM application, we can check for valid API keys in every API request. This is currently only done to allow access to private sources for admins, and to enable create/update/delete in the REST API. For security reasons create/update/delete only works from requests originating from the same computer.

#### Documentation

The documentation in the wiki is now included in the application, making it easier for users to find documentation. We use the [github-markdown gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/github-markdown) for this. The documentation has been updated with the changes in ALM 2.8, and other updates.

#### Other Changes

Many small changes and bug fixes. We now use memcached for caching, and we added to cron jobs to clean up temporary tables (error_messages and api_requests).

## ALM 2.7 (May 16, 2013)

[ALM 2.7](https://github.com/lagotto/alm/releases/tag/v.2.7) was released on May 16, 2013. The development work focused on adding Javascript libraries that talk to the ALM API and can be embedded in other web sites.

#### Javascript single article visualizations

We added visualizations for single articles using the d3.js library, including time-based visualizations by day, month and year. We have created a new [Github repository](https://github.com/lagotto/almviz) that will hold all future work on Javascript libraries talking to the ALM API. To make these visualizations easier we made two changes to the [v3 ALM API](API):

* added signposts (views, shares, bookmarks, citations) as summary information
* added metrics by day, month and year for every source

#### Other Changes

We have made it easier to install the ALM application by adding and testing support for Amazon AWS via Vagrant. We added rake tasks to seed or delete articles, and to delete resolved errors and old API requests. Many small bugs were fixed and the ALM application was updated to use the latest Rails version (3.2.13).

## ALM 2.6 (March 19, 2013)

[ALM 2.6](https://github.com/lagotto/alm/releases/tag/v.2.6) was released on March 19, 2013. The development work focused on two areas: API performance and easy installation.

#### API Performance

The API code was refactored, adding the [Draper Decorator](https://github.com/drapergem/draper) between the model and the [RABL Views](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl). We added caching, using Russian Doll fragment caching as described [here](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3113-how-key-based-cache-expiration-works). It required some extra work to make this work with RABL and Draper. We also added a visualization of API requests to the admin dashboard, using d3.js and the [crossfiler](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/) library.

#### Easy Installation

To make it easier to install the ALM application, we have updated and throughoutly tested the [manual installation](installation) instructions, updated the Chef / Vagrant automated installation (now using Ubuntu 12.04 and linking directly to the Chef Cookbook repository), and provided a VMware image of ALM application (535 MB [download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9406373/alm_ubuntu_12.04_vmware.tar.gz), username/password: alm). The VMware image file is still experimental and feedback is appreciated.

An updated version of [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) (1.1) was released days after ALM 2.6, and this version now supports VMware and AWS. We will support these platforms in a future ALM release to again make it easier to test or install the ALM application.

#### Other Changes

This release includes many small fixes and improvements. Of particular interest are the RSS feeds for the most popular articles by source, published in the last 7 days, 30 days, 12 months, or all-time. The RSS feeds are link from the most-cited lists for each source, e.g. [here](http://alm.plos.org/sources/twitter).
